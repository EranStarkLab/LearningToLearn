## **LearningToLearn**

This repository contains MATLAB routines used to generate the Figures of Levi, Aviv, Stark, 2024, PNAS Nexsus (https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae203/7676433)

## Overview
Humans excel at learning from examples and adapting to new rules, but conditions for
efficient learning in non-human subjects are unclear. We explored the rapid adaptability of mice
to new rules using a visual discrimination task. We found that mice can learn a new rule within a
single session, a capacity that enhances with experience and varies with rule difficulty.
Furthermore, mice exhibit flexibility in learning strategy, based on the physical conditions of the
task. The code available in this repository was used to perform the analysis resulting in Figures 2-4 and supplamentry Figures S1-S2 of the paper "Learning to learn: Single session acquisition of new rules by freely-moving mice".
